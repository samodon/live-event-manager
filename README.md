# Live Event Manager

For this weeks hackathon I will be implementing a web application using Golang to create a live shopping event manager for influencers. Influencers will be able to select the products that they want to put on sale, create events with those products and notify their followers whenever an event is created.
On the Influencer Side you will host the events
On the User side it will show a feed of the users tiktok followings, listing their events etc
